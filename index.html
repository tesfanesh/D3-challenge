          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>We examined the outcome (for state-level data) of obesity, smoking, and uninsured (healthcare) percentages
            based on three factors, poverty level (percentage below poverty line), median age, and median household
            income.
            We found a positive correlation between poverty levels and levels of unisured individuals. We see similar
            correlations
            with obesity and smoking levels. Conversely, we see negative correlations between all three outcomes and
            median household income.
            This tracks with the poverty correlations, as in general, we expect the poverty percentage to decrease as
            median household income increases.
          </p>

          <p>With median age, we see some less obvious correlations. There might be a weak negative correlation
          between median age and the uninsured percentage of the population.
          Meanwhile, the smoking percentage shows a positive correlation, as older populations appear to smoke more. Finally,
          we see no visible correlation between median age and obesity rates.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is interesting to note a few other extreme values. Texas had by the highest uninsured rate. It,
            and Georgia, stand out. In a different category, Utah has the lowest percentage of smokers
            among all states. Admittedly, though, Utah is also the youngest state by median age,
            and smoking percentage does tend to decrease with a younger population.
